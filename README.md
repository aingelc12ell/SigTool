First release (v0.1.0) can be expected soon(-ish). Work has began, but isn't yet usable nor stable enough to be released at this time.

### Requirements (currently anticipated; likely to evolve as development progresses):

#### Minimum.
- PHP &gt;= `7.0.3` with zlib + Phar support.
- &gt;= 1GB free disk space (if working directly from disk) or available RAM (if using a RAM drive; recommended).
- Ability to operate PHP in CLI mode (command prompt, terminal, shell, etc).
