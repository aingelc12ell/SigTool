- [2017.08.22; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added new options for offsets in
  signatures. Removed some duplicated code. Removed processing for terminal
  offsets (I don't think these really exist in ClamAV signatures, and what I
  was treating as these in the ClamAV signatures, are for something else, that
  we don't need for phpMussel, and I'd misunderstood about them before).

=== Version/Release 0.1.0 ===
FIRST TAGGED RELEASE.
